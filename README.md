#### Resturant Reviews App

## Project Overview:

Given a static design that lacks accessibility, convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Dependencies

## How to Use

Fork this respository, then clone it to your local machine. Create a simple HTTP server using Python. _Note: You do not need to know Python for this._  Check your Python version before starting by running `python -V` from the terminal.

#### If using Python 2
- spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

#### If using Python 3
- spin up the server with `python3 -m http.server 8000`

Once the server is up and running, navigate to `localhost:8000` to see the app in action!
